# Getting solutions and updates for labs

## Steps:

 1. Use `Terminal` to `cd` to the git repository on your machine for the lab for which you want solutions.
    For the sake of this explanation, we are going to use `Lab_Python_00`, but simply
    replace that with the name of the lab that you want and follow along.

 2. Make sure your working directory is a git repository, in this example, it should be `Lab_Python_00` 

 3. Type and run

    `git remote add instructors https://github.com/aiti-ghana-2012/Lab_Python_00.git`
    
    Of course, replace `Lab_Python_00` if you are working in a different repository.

 4. Type `git pull instructors master`

 5. And yippee! You have solutions!
